# RedditToYouTube
This program gets video links from music subreddits and adds them to a YouTube playlist.

For the redditTracks.py file, you will need a redditSecrets.py file with your own Reddit API credentials.
The fields needed are:
1. client_id
2. client_secret
3. username
4. user_agent

The Google authorization process for APIs is a bit more complex to write down here so I would recommend following Corey Schafer's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th5_9woFJmk). He makes use of Pickle and is easy to follow.
